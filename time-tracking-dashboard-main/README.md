## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox (not too much)
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

It was useful to recap how Grid works and sharp some knowledge.

Also I think the way I organize my code,  either HTML, CSS or JS, is better;more semantic
and reusable.



### Continued development
When I started working with the JSON file I got the idea to make an API, so maybe I will
do a similar project but with an API.
