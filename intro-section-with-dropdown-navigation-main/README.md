## Overview

- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
This was, for me, a quiet challenging project. I had to learn to create many
things i didn't know how to use them.

It took me around 10hr (maybe more).

Now I started with desktop, in fact, the styles of the "desktop.css" file are also used
in the mobile. The css files might be trash however I am proud about the smaller support 
I had for this challenge.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow // not this time =(

### What I learned
Well, I gotta mention that I had no idea how to create a dropdown menu; but I was able
to built one. However, my new experience working with "grid-css" is amazing, I wanted to use
a little more "grid-css" because I use it occasionally. Maybe it is not the best job but 
it makes me proud. 

### Continued development

I am planning to rebuild this project using react.js (framework I will learn soon)
